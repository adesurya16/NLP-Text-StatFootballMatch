A brief respite for Tottenham, as the. Visitors enjoy a spell of possession before Kane heads wide from a cross from the right. Moments later, though, Lacazette is almost in again, with Lloris having to rush off his line to clear.
A cynical tackle from Xhaka, who is fortunate to escape a booking after he scythed down Sissoko, with Mike Dean electing to let the foul go unpunished.
Kane clears the corner, but Arsenal keep up the pressure, with Sanchez twice finding space on the right flank. Both times, though, the winger fails to find a teammate.
Tottenham’s defence are under some pressure, now, with Vertonghen’s mistake giving Arsenal a free-kick in a dangerous position. Xhaka whips in a decent ball, and the visitors concede a corner…
CHANCE! What an opportunity for the Gunners! Ramsey’s sublime throughball unleashes Bellerin down the right, and the Spaniard proceeds to deliver a superb cross into the six-yard box. Lacazette looks all set to tuck it home, but Dier and Sanchez just seem to do enough to put Arsenal’s striker off.
A bit of a French connection, there! Koscielny looks to thread a long, looping pass into Lacazette, who had got behind Tottenham’s defence. Lloris, however, reacts swiftly to intervene.
Great work from Sissoko down the right sees the midfielder get the better of Monreal before cutting the ball back to Alli. He takes a touch to set himself, but his cross-cum-shot is cleared before Kane can get on the end of it.
GREAT DEFENDING! That’s good play from Davinson Sanchez, who does well to prod Alexis Sanchez’s header - which was aimed for the onrushing Lacazette - away from danger.
